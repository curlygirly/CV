## Jennifer Arad-Marks

A creative and enthusiastic junior web developer and novice trapeze flyer, with a passion for change and improving the world we live in. Following a successful career as a transformation consultant, I decided let my creativity out and channel it and the skills I gained as a consultant, into the exhilarating and dynamic world of web development. As complete newbie to the world of tech and coding, I recently graduated from the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), having discovered a genuine passion and an unquenchable thirst for developing and designing beautiful, yet useful and usable code and web technology. 

I am currently volunteering with at [Agile Ventures](http://www.agileventures.org/), but I am looking for an exciting and innovative junior role within a friendly yet stimulating and challenging environment. I am keen and enthusiastic to learn more and develop my skills further, contributing to inspiring yet exciting projects.

## Skills

#### Software Development

I am graduate of Makers Academy 12 week immersive coding boot camp, where I was introduced to a wealth of technologies and methodologies, embedding core coding skills and principles. Key learning concepts were pair programming, MVP, TDD/BDD, code design principles such as OOP and SOLID, and group work implementing Agile best practices such as SCRUM.  I was taught best practices by world class developers and was given a fantastic exposure to the full tech stack, with particular focus on the following technologies:

Technology | Language/Framework/Tool
-----------|------------------------
**Front End** | HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Angular.js
**Back End** | Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js
**Databases & ORMs** | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL, ActiveRecord, DataMapper
**Testing** | RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Cucumber, Karma, Protractor
**Other** | REST(ful) APIs, version control (Git), AJAX, JSON
**Soft Skills** | Agile, pair programming, group work, communication


#### Since Graduating from Makers Academy….

I have continued to develop my skills and investigate other technologies. I have a keen interest in the design and creation of apps and have recently begun to learn Swift and am thoroughly enjoying exploring what it can achieve. I have also been interacting with the burgeoning Swift community, attending meet-ups. Currently I am learning how to test Swift with XCode and I am looking forward to expanding my skills further and learn to use Metal. 

#### Design

I have always had an appreciation for clean and effective design that is both functional and beautiful, and an eye for what does and doesn’t work.  In my previous roles I was actively involved in design aspects of the projects I worked on; whether that was regarding, brand, the website or marketing materials. 

  •	Currently expanding my knowledge and learning the principles of good UX/UI design, bringing my knowledge into new projects. 
  •	I have previously worked with and experimented in Photoshop and Balsamiq. 
  •	I am improving my design skills, and am looking to learn about 3D design.

## Other skills

#### Project Management

I have been responsible for successfully planning, managing and delivering a range of projects across the private, public and third sectors. Example projects include:  

  •	Writing and implementing a strategy for a £35m charity.
  •	Project managing the set up of 7 Academies as part of the Governments Education policy.
  •	Developed the expansion plan for a national coffee shop chain.

#### Communication & Teamwork

I am very friendly and have always found the greatest rewards can be found working with others, as the perspectives and insights gained can be incredibly valuable. I thrive on team dynamics, whether that is managing or being part of a team and constant and clear communication is integral to the success of team projects.

  •	Pair-programming everyday at Makers Academy was both educational and inspirational. 
  •	Engaging with and managing the expectations of clients, contractors and often the general public was a key part of my job leading to excellent communication skills.
  
#### Innovative and Analytical

A huge part of my role as a consultant was analysing difficult situations and developing unique solutions to problems, which often threatened to derail projects. However, recognising when something was not working and having the ability and strength make, often large, changes was another skill.

  •	Developed and established and operating charitable foundation from its inception. 
  •	I led the research, design and production of various targeting campaigns and developed tailored pitches and proposals to attract and secure new clients.
